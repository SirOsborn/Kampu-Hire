Throughout my academic journey, I have improved my writing, research, and public speaking skills, which help me explain concepts clearly and effectively.

The resume details academic pursuits and teaching-related activities (tutoring, class monitoring, lesson assistance). There is a complete absence of any marketing-related experience or skills. While the candidate expresses adaptability and a willingness to learn, these are insufficient to compensate for the lack of foundational marketing knowledge required for a Marketing Manager role. The skills analysis reveals a significant gap between the required skills (marketing strategy, campaign management, digital marketing) and the candidate's demonstrated skills (communication, research - which are general skills). The education level is assumed to be a bachelor's degree, but the field of study is not specified, contributing to a low field relevance score. The cultural fit appears positive based on communication style, but this is overshadowed by the lack of core competencies.","['Adaptability', 'Willingness to learn']","['Lack of marketing experience', 'Missing critical marketing skills']"
